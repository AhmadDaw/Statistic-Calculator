A clear and simple desktop application to quikly generate statistics (Mean, Max, Min, Sum) and summerize the data in one click, build using Python, Pandas and Tkinter, the application read the data from excel file or database and preprocess the data and output the statistics to an Excel file,tested on real world data.

To run the code follow the steps:

1. Create the virtual environment in Python. You can name it anything, here we'll use "myenv": 
`virtualenv myenv`

2. Activate the virtual environment:

- On Linux/Mac: 
`source myenv/bin/activate` 
- On Windows:
`myenv\Scripts\activate`

4. Your command prompt will now start with `(myenv)` indicating you are in the virtual environment.

5. To recreate the environment run: 
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

6. To deactivate the virtual environment, run:

- On Linux/Mac: 
`deactivate`
- On Windows: 
`deactivate.bat` 

Your command prompt will no longer have `(myenv)`
